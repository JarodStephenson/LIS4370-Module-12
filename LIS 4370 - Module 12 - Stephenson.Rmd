```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Mtcars Analysis

This code will analyze the built-in mtcars dataset by displaying summary statistics 
and plotting the attributes of the dataset.

```{r cars}
summary(mtcars)

#Displays the mean value of the mpg column in the mtcars dataset.
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(mtcars)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl, y = mpg, color = gear)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Mpg vs. Cyl")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. This concludes the Module #12 R Markdown assignment.
